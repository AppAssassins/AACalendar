Not yet implemented



NOTES:

All counters are 1 based

TO DO:

Highlight 'today'
Set focus left/right to move between rows
Find way to hide/show rows without causing delay
Documentation/comments once things are semi stable
Redo onClickListener for cells
BUGFIX: crash on year change / keep date to be shown in a calendar. change calendar->updateView()
Decide what exactly should be part of the CalendarLayout (incl. buttons and labels or just grid?)
Save layout on destroy, restore (rather than calculate) on resume
